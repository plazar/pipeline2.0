\section{Installation}
\subsection{Dependencies}
The PALFA pipeline has various dependencies. All of the following packages are required to run the pipeline.
\begin{itemize}
    \item PRESTO (a recent version is required. The new executable \texttt{fitsdelcol} must be included - https://github.com/scottransom/presto)
    \item psrfits\_utils (be sure to pull Kevin Stovall's version of psrfits\_utils. It contains the merging code required to analyse PALFA Mock spectrometer data. https://github.com/kstovall/psrfits\_utils.git)
    \item numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
    \item M2Crypto (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/M2Crypto)
    \item PBSQuery (if PBS is being used - http://subtrac.sara.nl/oss/pbs\_python/wiki/TorqueInstallation)
    \item pyfits (http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software\_hardware/pyfits)
    \item pyodbc (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyodbc/)
    \item suds (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/suds)
    \item python2.6 (for the Downloader)
    \item ImageMagick (on worker nodes - http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
    \item FreeTDS (required by pyodbc to connect to common-DB - http://www.freetds.org/)
    \item UnixODBC (required by pyodbc to connect to common-DB - http://www.unixodbc.org/)
    \item prettytable (http://code.google.com/p/prettytable/)
\end{itemize}

\textit{NOTE: Some of these dependencies have requirements of their own. For example, PRESTO requires cfitsio, TEMPO, numpy, scipy, etc. Be sure to follow the installation instructions for each packages.}

\subsection{Getting Started}
Here we will present basic step-by-step instructions for setting up the pipeline.

\begin{description}
    \item[Step 1] Create a directory where you want the pipeline to be installed.

    \item[Step 2] Download the pipeline source files. This should be done by cloning the git repository on github.com: https://github.com/plazar/pipeline2.0.

        \smallskip

        \texttt{\$ git clone git://github.com/plazar/pipeline2.0.git}

        \smallskip
        
        \textit{NOTE: This will create a sub-directory called ``pipeline2.0".} 

    \item[Step 3] Add the pipeline's lib/python directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. 

    \item[Step 4] Create configuration files using the examples provided. Modify the settings so they are appropriate for your system. It is possible to check the sanity of your configurations by calling a configuration file with the python interpreter. An error message will be displayed if a configuration type or value is invalid.  

    \item[Step 5] Set up the database. This is done using the \texttt{create\_database.py} script.

    \item[Step 6] Perform tests. In the \texttt{test/} directory there are some tests that can be run to see if you can connect to the common DB (\texttt{commondb\_test.py}), e-mail system (\texttt{MailerTest.py}), and FTP server (\texttt{cornellftp\_test.py}). To perform the tests call each script with the python interpreter.

    \item[Step 7] Start the downloader using \texttt{StartDownloader.py}.
        
        \smallskip
        
        \textit{NOTE: The downloader does not need to be run on the same computer as the job pooler. However, the directory where the downloader saves files must be accessible from the computer where the job pooler is being run.}
        
        \smallskip
        
        Alternatively, it is possible to add files to the job-tracker database without using the downloader. To do this use \texttt{add\_files.py}. Be sure to set the \texttt{delete\_rawdata} configuration to \texttt{False} if you do not want raw data files to be deleted when the pipeline no longer requires them. 

    \item[Step 8] Start the job pooler using \texttt{StartJobPool.py}. The job pooler will start submitting jobs when data files are finished downloading. 

    \item[Step 9] Start the uploader using \texttt{StartJobUploader.py}. The uploader will upload results to the common database when jobs are successfully processed.
\end{description}


\section{The Pipeline}
An overview of the pipeline.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sanity check of configurations
    \item Dynamic zapping
    \item Automatic download of data files
    \item File size checks when downloading
    \item Notification of errors by email
    \item Automatic (configurable) retry of failed jobs
    \item Results are uploaded as a single transaction, so no partial uploads when errors occur
    \item Automatic (configurable) deletion of data files (upon success or terminal failure)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Components}
\subsubsection{Job-tracking Database}
Each job run through the pipeline passes through multiple stages before it is completed. To track the state of each job, and log its history a SQLite3 database is used. The database is simply a (readable/writable) binary file formatted according to the SQLite3 format. The database file can be access using SQL statements using python's sqlite3 module, which is part of python's standard library, as of python version 2.5.

Relevant links:
\begin{itemize}
    \item http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html
    \item http://www.sqlite.org/
\end{itemize}

The job-tracker database governs all aspects of the pipeline. It maintains lists of requests for data, downloads, jobs, files associated with each job, processing attempts, and upload attempts.

Details for each table in the database are presented in Section \ref{sec:dbdetails}.

\subsubsection{Downloader}
\subsubsection{Job Pooler}
\subsubsection{Uploader}
\paragraph{Headers}

\paragraph{Candidates}

\paragraph{Diagnostics}
Diagnostics stored in the common database are split into two types: Numeric values and binary data. Some of the ``binary data" diagnostics are actually plain text files.

The following per-beam diagnostics are uploaded to the common database:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{RFI mask percentage} (Numeric value) \hfill \\
        Percentage of data masked due to RFI.

    \item \textit{Num cands folded} (Numeric Value) \hfill \\
        The number of candidates folded.

    \item \textit{Num cands produced} (Numeric Value) \hfill \\
        The total number of candidates produced, including those with sigma lower than the folding threshold.

    \item \textit{Min sigma folded} (Numeric value) \hfill \\
        The smallest sigma value of all folded candidates from this beam.

    \item \textit{Num cands above threshold} (Numeric value) \hfill \\
        The number of candidates produced (but not necessarily folded) that are above the desired sigma threshold.
    
    \item \textit{RFIfind png} (Binary data) \hfill \\
        Output image produced by rfifind in png format.

    \item \textit{Accelcands list} (Binary data) \hfill \\
        The combined and sifted list of candidates produced by accelsearch.
    
    \item \textit{Zaplist used} (Binary data) \hfill \\
        The list of frequencies and ranges zapped from the power spectrum before searching this beam.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generic Queue Manager Interface}
The Pipeline interacts with the system's queue manager using an abstract interface. This generic interface can be implemented with the specific queue manager installed on the system. The system-specific queue manager class must be derived from the \texttt{PipelineQueueManager} class. Each of the following methods of \texttt{PipelineQueueManager} must be implemented in the derived class:

\begin{description}
    \item[submit] Submits a job to queue manager with files list and output directory. Must return a unique string identifier for the submitted job. Raises ValueError if job was not submitted by queue manager.

    \item[is\_running] Given a unique identifier for a job, must return True or False whether the job is running or not, respectively.

    \item[delete] Given a unique identifier for a job, remove the corresponding job from the queue. Returns True if the job was delete, False if an error occured.

    \item[status] Return the status of the queue, i.e. the number of jobs running and the number of jobs queued.

    \item[had\_errors] Given a unique identifier for a job, return True, or False whether the job terminated with an error, or not, respectively.

    \item[get\_errors] Given a unique identifier for a job, return the contents of the error log. If there were not errors return an empty string.
\end{description}


\subsection{Configurations}
\label{sec:configs}

The pipeline requires a series of configurations to be set in order to run. The configurations for different aspects of the pipeline are divided into the different files. The configuration files can be found in the pipeline's lib/python/config/ directory.

A sanity check of configurations is performed each time a configuration file is imported. If there are errors (e.g. a setting isn't provided, a directory doesn't exist, etc.) a message is printed to the terminal, and an exception is raised causing the program to exit. It is possible to run the check the sanity of a configuration file by running it. For example, checking the sanity of \texttt{basic.py}:

\texttt{python basic.py}

If the settings are sane there will be no error message is output. \textit{NOTE: it may be necessary to check the sanity of the processing configurations on the worker nodes.}

Each of required settings in each of the configration files are listed below:

\subsubsection{basic.py}

\end{description}


\subsubsection{searching.py}
The search parameters of the pipeline are located in \texttt{searching.py}. To ensure searching is done uniformly across all processing sites most of these values shouldn't be modified.

\begin{description}
    \item[use\_subbands] A boolean value that determines if we'll dedisperse and fold using subbands. In general, it is a very good idea to use them if there is enough scratch space on the machines that are processing ($\sim$30GB/beam processed).
    \item[fold\_rawdata] A boolean value that determines if folding should be done from the raw FITS files (as opposed to subbands or dedispersed FITS files).

\begin{description}
    \item[version\_num] The version number of the current version of the pipeline (including versions of \texttt{PRESTO} and \texttt{psrfits\_utils}). The preferred format is:
    
    \texttt{PRESTO:\{git-hash\};PIPELINE:\{git-hash\};PSRFITS\_UTILS\{git-hash\}}. 
    
    It is \textbf{strongly} recommended that the git-hash values are retrieved dynamically, so they are always up-to date. However, if this is not possible you are able to hard code values of the git-hashes, but they should be changed every time the versions of the software used are modified.
\end{description}


\subsection{Job-Tracker Database Details}
\label{sec:dbdetails}

The job-tracker database contains six tables: \texttt{requests}, \texttt{files}, \texttt{download\_attempts}, \texttt{jobs}, \texttt{job\_files}, and \texttt{job\_submits}. Each of these tables is meant to track a particular object (e.g. jobs), or events (e.g. job submissions to the queue).

A description of each database table will now be presented:

\subsubsection{\texttt{requests}}
The \texttt{requests} table tracks requests for data restores. An entry in the table is inserted when a request is made. Each entry contains the following data:
\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER) A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[size] (INTEGER) Total size of the files restored, in bytes.
    \item[guid] (TEXT) A globally unique identifier for the restore. This serves as the directory name on the FTP server where the restored files will be placed.
    \item[status] (TEXT) The current status of the request.
    \item[details] (TEXT) Details about the request.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the request entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the request entry was last updated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{files}
The \texttt{files} table tracks each file available to the pipeline. A separate entry is inserted for each file. Each entry contains the following data:

\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER)  A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[filename] (TEXT) The name of the file.
    \item[remote\_filename] (TEXT) The name and path of the downloaded file on the FTP server.
    \item[request\_id] (INTEGER) The identifier of the entry in the \texttt{requests} table that restored this file.
    \item[status] (TEXT) The current status of the file.
    \item[details] (TEXT) Details about the file.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the file entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the file entry was last updated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{download\_attempts}
Every time one an attempt to download one of the files listed in the \texttt{files} table an entry is created in the \texttt{download\_attempts} table. Each download attempt entry has the following data:

\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER)  A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[request\_id] (INTEGER) The identifier of the entry in the \texttt{files} table that this download attempt corresponds to.
    \item[status] (TEXT) The current status of the download attempt.
    \item[details] (TEXT) Details about the current status of the download attempt.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the download attempt entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the download attempt entry was last updated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{jobs}
Each beam-worth of data gets submitted to be processed as a single job. These jobs are tracked in the \texttt{jobs} table, and have the following data:

\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER)  A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[status] (TEXT) The current status of the job.
    \item[details] (TEXT) Details about the current status of the job.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the job entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the job entry was last updated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{job\_files}
Because a job can have multiple files a mapping between jobs and files is required. The \texttt{job\_files} table serves this purpose. Each row in the table has the following data:

\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER)  A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[file\_id] (INTEGER) The indentifier of an entry in the \texttt{files} table.
    \item[job\_id] (INTEGER) The identifier of an entry in the \texttt{jobs} table that the file referred to by \texttt{file\_id} belongs to.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the entry was last updated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{job\_submits}
Each submission of a job to the queue to be processed is tracked in the \texttt{job\_submits} table. Each job submission has the following information:

\begin{description}
    \item[id] (UNIQUE INTEGER)  A unique identifier, automatically assigned by the database upon creation of an entry.
    \item[queue\_id] (TEXT) The unique identifier assigned to the job by the queue manager when it is submitted. This identified is used to check if the submission is still being processed.
    \item[job\_id] (INTEGER) The identifier of the job (from the \texttt{jobs} table) that was submitted for processing.
    \item[output\_dir] (TEXT) The directory where the results of processing will be output.
    \item[status] (TEXT) The current status of the job.
    \item[details] (TEXT) Details about the current status of the job.
    \item[created\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the entry was created.
    \item[updated\_at] (TEXT) Date and time when the entry was last updated.
\end{description}
